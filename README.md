# Bookmark URL

An OpenSeadragon plugin for updating the zoom/pan in the page URL.

## Usage

Create your OpenSeadragon viewer and then:

```
viewer.bookmarkUrl();
```

It'll take the viewer to wherever the page's hash parameters point, and it'll update the page URL with hash parameters.

See demo.html for an example.
